/**
 * Mythara's agentic runtime — same shape as Crush's main loop.
 *
 * Per user turn:
 *   1. Persist the user message to history.
 *   2. Snapshot the entire conversation, hand it to MiniMax with the
 *      tools-array attached.
 *   3. Stream the model's response. If it ends in `finish_reason=stop`,
 *      we're done — emit Finished.
 *   4. If it ends in `finish_reason=tool_calls`, persist the assistant
 *      message (text + tool_calls), execute each tool, persist a
 *      `role:tool` message per result, then loop back to step 2 with
 *      the enlarged history. The model sees its tool results and either
 *      generates text or calls more tools.
 *   5. MAX_ITERATIONS caps the loop so a buggy model can't burn the
 *      user's quota forever; the cap shows up as Turn.Finished with a
 *      sentinel suffix.
 *
 * The emitted [Turn] flow lets the UI render tool-call cards in real
 * time — Crush-style "● Reading file…" → "✓ Reading file (0.4s)".
